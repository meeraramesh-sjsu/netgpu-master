It is with immense gratitude that I acknowledge the support of my advisor Dr. Hyeran Jeon throughout the thesis. Prof. Hyeran is one of the best Professors I've met and I've learned many things from her, the most important quality I cultivated because of her is patience.  I would also like to thank my co-advisor Dr. Younghee Park for monitoring the progress of the project and for providing me good ideas to solve certain issues I had faced.  I am also very thankful to Dr. Xiao Su for being a part of the committee and for providing her advice on the future scope of the thesis.

I am indebted to my parents and my brother for instilling confidence in me.  I'm thankful to my in-laws for their constant support and motivation.  I'm also thankful to my friend Sindhuja, who gave her ear to my problems.

This thesis would have remained a dream had it not been for the support from my husband Karthik, and I owe my deepest gratitude to him.
