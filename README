NetGPU framework README file

	Netgpu is a Framework that tries to simplify the task of programming network traffic analysis using Graphical Processor Units (GPUs) to enhance performance, and particulary using NVIDIA's CUDA library . 

	The package contains 3 components:
		* NetGPU framework and tools
		* Code Modules (~ basic analysis libraries)
		* Examples

Check www.netgpu.org for documentation and more info.
